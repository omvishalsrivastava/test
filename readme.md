## 📖 Overview

OpenMars is a web-based aerospace mission planning platform designed to help students, enthusiasts, and aspiring engineers explore the challenges of interplanetary travel.

The platform evaluates Earth-to-Mars missions by calculating mass ratios, propellant requirements, payload fractions, and mission feasibility using the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation.

Users can compare multiple propulsion technologies and understand how propulsion choices affect mission architecture.

## ✨ Features

### Mission Planning

* Payload Mass Input
* Dry Mass Input
* Mission Delta-V Configuration
* Engine Selection
* Mission Feasibility Analysis

### Propulsion Systems

| System                            | Specific Impulse |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Chemical Propulsion               | 450 s            |
| Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)  | 900 s            |
| Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) | 3000 s           |

### Mission Calculations

OpenMars calculates:

* Mass Ratio
* Initial Mass
* Final Mass
* Propellant Mass
* Propellant Fraction
* Payload Fraction

### Results Dashboard

* Mission Summary
* Propellant Requirements
* Vehicle Mass Breakdown
* Transit Estimates

* Engine Performance Comparisons
* Propellant Fraction Analysis

---

## 🔬 Physics Model

OpenMars uses the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation:

Δv = Isp × g₀ × ln(m₀ / m₁)

Where:

* Δv = Mission Delta-V
* Isp = Specific Impulse
* g₀ = Standard Gravity
* m₀ = Initial Mass
* m₁ = Final Mass

This equation forms the foundation of modern spacecraft propulsion analysis and is used to estimate propellant requirements for interplanetary missions.
